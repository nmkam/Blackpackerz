	<p>Hello and welcome to our homepage! I'm Eb from Nantwich <i>and I'm Nick from Luton</i>. In August 2018 we decided that we wanted to travel the world together with our first goal being to complete a Working Holiday Visa (WHV) in Australia so we started saving and working towards our dream and just over a year later on September 1st 2019, we set off from Heathrow Airport bound for Bangkok where we spent 2 months together in Thailand, travelling from Kanchanaburri, to Koh Tao, to Koh Phangnan and finally to Chiang Mai.</p><br>
	<p><i>At the end of October, I left Eb behind in Chiang Mai and headed to Perth in Western Australia. Eb joined me at the end of November and after buying a car, we set off on our Aussie journey, travelling and sight-seeing up and down the west coast!</i></p>
