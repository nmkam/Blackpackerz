	<p>Hello and welcome to our homepage! We are Eb and Nick from Nantwich and Luton (in the UK) respectively. In August 2018 we decided that we wanted to travel the world together. At the time Eb had been working as a live in carer for 5 years and Nick had been in a number of jobs. We decided that we would start saving and working towards our dream and just over a year later, we set off from Heathrow Airport bound for Bangkok where we spent a month and a half together in Thailand, travelling from Kanchanaburri, to Koh Tao, to Koh Phangnan and finally to Chiang Mai. </p>
